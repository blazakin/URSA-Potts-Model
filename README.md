# URSA-Potts-Model

Code created to implement the Metropolis algorithm for a four substance Potts model. More information on the research at [https://www.felsch.io/SPS24](https://www.felsch.io/SPS24)

This is based of the work of Peszynska et al. (2021) and the code is modified from Shonkwiler and
Mendivil (2009).
